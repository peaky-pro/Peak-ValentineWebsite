            <p id="heartfeltMessage">I know that on Valentine‚Äôs Day, people usually give a bouquet of flowers. But I promise that every flower I couldn‚Äôt give you now, I will give you when we meet. And not just then, throughout the time I hope we‚Äôll share in the future.

                You deserve to be loved like a habit‚Äîsomeone to kiss your forehead when you‚Äôre both up and down, someone who can carry you on their shoulders. You deserve someone who thinks you‚Äôre beautiful even with bedhead, someone who shows up with your favorite snacks on a bad day.
                
                You deserve flowers‚Äîhell, a whole garden of them. You deserve kisses, love letters, and someone who cherishes you in every way possible.
                
                And I want to be that person. I will be that person. I would love nothing more than to be that person for you.
                
                I love you, Nashley.
